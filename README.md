## Problem Description
Background: The Ministry of Agriculture faces several challenges that hinder the growth and sustainability of the agricultural sector. Climate change, soil degradation, and water scarcity pose significant threats to crop production, affecting food security. Farmers often struggle with low incomes due to high input costs, fluctuating market prices, and inadequate access to financial support. Additionally, the lack of modernization and limited adoption of advanced technologies reduce productivity and efficiency in farming. Poor infrastructure, inefficient supply chains, and post-harvest losses further impact profitability. Moreover, gaps in policy implementation, bureaucratic delays, and a lack of awareness among farmers create barriers to effective agricultural development. Addressing these issues requires a combination of sustainable practices, financial support, technological advancements, and policy reforms to ensure a resilient and prosperous agricultural sector.
