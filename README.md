SIH 1653: Web based Selector-Applicant Simulation Software
## Problem Description
Background:The Ministry of Agriculture faces numerous challenges in ensuring food security, sustainable farming, and rural development. Climate change, unpredictable weather patterns, and soil degradation threaten crop yields, while inefficient irrigation and deforestation further strain resources. Farmers often struggle with limited access to modern technology, financial support, and stable markets, making agricultural growth difficult. Additionally, pest infestations and crop diseases reduce productivity, exacerbating food shortages. Poor supply chain infrastructure leads to significant post-harvest losses, while fluctuating prices and inadequate policies create economic instability for farmers. Addressing these issues requires investment in smart farming technologies, improved storage and distribution networks, climate-resilient crops, and supportive government policies to promote sustainability and long-term agricultural success.
## Problem Creater's Organization
Ministry of Agriculture

## Idea

1. **Smart Farming** â€“ Use AI, IoT, drones for precision agriculture.  
2. **Sustainable Practices** â€“ Promote organic farming, water conservation, and agroforestry.  
3. **Farmer Support** â€“ Provide loans, direct market access, and price stabilization policies.  
4. **R&D Innovation** â€“ Develop climate-resilient crops, biodegradable fertilizers, and agri-tech hubs.  
5. **Supply Chain Improvement** â€“ Build cold storage, improve transport, and use blockchain for transparency.  
6. **Youth & Women Empowerment** â€“ Offer training, startup support, and urban farming programs.
